# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation-with-Predictive-Modeling
In this project, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of credit card customer data to enhance our understanding and service offerings. Initially, I conducted exploratory data analytics (EDA) to uncover valuable insights and patterns within the dataset, ensuring a deep understanding of customer behavior and characteristics. Following the EDA, I employed K-means clustering to segment the customers into distinct groups, or clusters, based on their spending patterns and other relevant features. These clusters not only revealed different levels of customer loyalty but also highlighted varying needs and preferences, which can be strategically used to tailor benefits and services.

To take this analysis further, I developed a predictive model using Random Forest, a robust machine learning algorithm. This model is designed to classify new customers into one of the pre-identified clusters upon opening a new account. By accurately predicting the cluster to which a new customer belongs, the model enables us to offer personalized benefits and incentives that align with their predicted needs and behavior, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. This dual approach of clustering and predictive modeling ensures that we can provide a highly personalized and rewarding experience for our credit card users.
